[https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Equilibria/Le_Chateliers_Principle/The_Contact_Process](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Equilibria/Le_Chateliers_Principle/The_Contact_Process)

- Step 1: Make sulfur dioxide
- Step 2: Convert sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide (the reversible reaction at the heart of the process)
- Step 3: Convert sulfur trioxide into concentrated sulfuric acid

### Part 1 – Equilibrium Systems (650-750 words)
Students will investigate ONE of the following processes:
• **Contact Process **OR
• Production of Ethene (Ethylene) from Natural Gases (eg. Ethane, Butane and Propane)

	

Students are expected to describe the important equilibrium reaction in their chosen industrial process. As part of this section students will:

**explain the importance of the industrial process, and the uses of the desired product**


**identify how different factors will affect the equilibrium reaction,**

#### Temperature

	- to produce maximum amount of sulfur trioxide, you need to shift right as much as possible
	- forward production of sulfur trioxide is exothermic
	- hence, we must lower temperature as much as possible, to produce much as possible
	- however, lower temp = lower rate of reaction, hence the actual temperature used is 400°C to 450°C, since it can do a fairly high proportion of sulfur trioxide in a relatively short time
		(use graph to show how this relationship)

o for each factor, explain the condition that would provide the optimal yield for the desired chemical in theequilibrium reaction

o describe the conditions that are used in the industrial process, and explain why these might be different to the ideal conditions, with a focus on safety, environmental or economic reasons

o demonstrate a thorough understanding of Collision Theory and Le Chatelier’s Principle to explain and predict how equilibrium systems respond to changing conditions.

o Include at least 1 graph that demonstrates the theoretical OR industrial conditions for the Equilibrium reaction AND a detailed description and interpretation of the information in the graph. This graph SHOULD relate to the equilibrium reaction that is part of your report.

### Part 2 – Industrial Design (650-750 words)

Students will investigate ONE of the following processes:
• Solvay Process (Penrice Factory, Osbourne South Australia)
• Ostwald Process (Orica Plant, Kooragang Island, NSW)

#### Design of Chemical Process
As part of this section students must:

Include a FLOW CHART for the industrial production of the chemical.


Describe the flow chart and identify any considerations for the enthalpy changes for different stages of the


process. If the reaction requires heat to be added to the system to increase yield, how do they produce the heat? Or if the reaction produces heat, what do they do with the heat?


Identify the risks involved with the chemical process, reactants, products, waste products involved in the reactions.

#### Location of Industrial Facility

Students are expected to ASSESS the location provided for the industrial production of the chemical based on 3 criteria:
• Address an ECONOMICAL consideration
• Address a separate ENVIRONMENTAL consideration
• Address ANOTHER consideration based on the LOCATION of the Industrial Process that has been
provided.

Having ASSESSED these criteria, students are expected to include a summative paragraph where they JUSTIFY the location provided as suitable or unsuitable.
